## Dev Requirements

- Unity 2018.1.5
- Git LFS (most Git clients will install this automatically when you clone this repo)



## Notes

After openning the Unity project, open the following scene to try it out: `FishDemo/Scenes/SampleScene`

The fish behavior is all defined in the file [`FishDemo/Scripts/Fish.cs`](Assets/FishDemo/Scripts/Fish.cs)

While the app is running, be sure to take a look at the editor viewport. It will show some debugging aids in the form of colored lines that communicate what each fish is "seeing", when it detects an obstacle, and how it plans to avoid the obstacle.
